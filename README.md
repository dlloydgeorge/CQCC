# CQCC
Code related to the Classiq quantum computing challenge. The specific problem I chose was the hamiltonian simulation problem. 
This problem involved finding the time evolution operator of a hamiltonian of a lithium hydride (LiH) molecule. The hamiltonian was given and was composed of 276 pauli strings, with each pauli string containing 10 terms. Qiskit was used as the quantum SDK for the project due to the prevalence of documentation and tutorials that made it easy to learn it quickly.
